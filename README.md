# Simple-2DEngine
My own 2D cross-platform "Engine" created in C++ with SDL2 and ImGui. This engine was created in order to improve my programming knowledge but eventually I'll use it as my main engine(I hope so).

# Current Features
  - Tile-based system
  - Animations
  - Map editor
  - Font system
  - "Different scenes" (actually simple machine state that needs to be added manually)

# Feature that will be added
  - Loading different textures through imgui layer
  - Enemies
  - Camera shaking

# Dependencies
  - ImGui
  - SDL2 2.28.5+
  - SDL2_image 2.8.2+
  - SDL2_mixer 2.8.0+
